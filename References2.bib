A step towards a theory on Evolutionary Algorithms, in particular, the so-called (1 + 1) Evolutionary Algorithm, is performed. Linear functions are proved to be optimized in expected time O(nlnn) but only mutation rates of size (1=n) can ensure this behavior. For some polynomial of degree 2 the optimization needs exponential time. The same is proved for a unimodal function. Both results were not expected by several other authors. Finally, a hierarchy result is proved. Moreover, methods are presented to analyze the behavior of the (1 + 1) Evolutionary Algorithm. c 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Coevolutionary algorithms are variants of traditional evolutionary algorithms and are often considered more suitable for certain kinds of complex tasks than noncoevolutionary methods. One example is a general cooperative coevolutionary framework for function optimization. This paper presents a thorough and rigorous introductory analysis of the optimization potential of cooperative coevolution. Using the cooperative coevolutionary framework as a starting point, the CC (1+1) EA is deﬁned and investigated from the perspective of the expected optimization time. The research concentrates on separability, a key property of objective functions. We show that separability alone is not sufﬁcient to yield any advantage of the CC (1+1) EA over its traditional, non-coevolutionary counterpart. Such an advantage is demonstrated to have its basis in the increased explorative possibilities of the cooperative coevolutionary algorithm. For inseparable functions, the cooperative coevolutionary set-up can be harmful. We prove that for some objective functions the CC (1+1) EA fails to locate a global optimum with overwhelming probability, even in inﬁnite time; however, inseparability alone is not sufﬁcient for an objective function to cause difﬁculties. It is demonstrated that the CC (1+1) EA may perform equal to its traditional counterpart, and may even outperform it on certain inseparable functions.},

	abstract = {Drift analysis is one of the state-of-the-art techniques for the runtime analysis of randomized search heuristics (RSHs) such as evolutionary algorithms (EAs), simulated annealing etc. The vast majority of existing drift theorems yield bounds on the expected value of the hitting time for a target state, e. g., the set of optimal solutions, without making additional statements on the distribution of this time. We address this lack by providing a general drift theorem that includes bounds on the upper and lower tail of the hitting time distribution. The new tail bounds are applied to prove very precise sharp-concentration results on the running time of a simple EA on standard benchmark problems, including the class of general linear functions. Surprisingly, the probability of deviating by an r-factor in lower order terms of the expected time decreases exponentially with r on all these problems. The usefulness of the theorem outside the theory of RSHs is demonstrated by deriving tail bounds on the number of cycles in random permutations. All these results handle a position-dependent (variable) drift that was not covered by previous drift theorems with tail bounds. Moreover, our theorem can be specialized into virtually all existing drift theorems with drift towards the target from the literature. Finally, user-friendly specializations of the general drift theorem are given.},

In this schematic model, the structure of the protein, which is encoded as a bit-string of length n, is evolved to its native conformation through a stochastic pathway of sequential contact bindings. We study the asymptotic behavior of the hitting time, in the mean case scenario, under two different mutations: the one flip which flips a unique bit chosen uniformly at random in the bit-string, and the Bernoulli flip which flips each bit in the bit-string independently with probability c/n. For each algorithm we prove a law of large numbers, a central limit theorem and compare the performance of the two models.},

	abstract = {Black-box optimization algorithms optimize a ﬁtness function f without knowledge of the speciﬁc parameters of the problem instance. Their run time is measured as the number of f -evaluations. This implies that the usual algorithmic complexity of a problem cannot be applied in the black-box scenario. Therefore, a new framework for the valuation of algorithms for black-box optimization is presented allowing the notion of the black-box complexity of a problem. For several problems upper and lower bounds on their black-box complexity are presented. Moreover, it can be concluded that randomized search heuristics whose (worst-case) expected optimization time for some problem is close to the black-box complexity of the problem are provably eﬃcient (in the black-box scenario). The new approach is applied to several problems based on typical example functions and further interesting problems. Run times of general EAs for these problems are compared with the black-box complexity of the problem.},

This has been conﬁrmed by numerical studies, e.g., in the context of evolutionary game theory (EGT) and population dynamics of simple two-strategy games with various types of replication and selection mechanisms. Using the framework of shadowing lemma, we study to what degree can such inﬁnite population dynamics: 1) be reliably simulated on ﬁnite precision computers; and 2) be trusted to represent coevolutionary dynamics of possibly very large, but ﬁnite, populations. In a simple EGT setting of two-player symmetric games with two pure strategies and a polymorphic equilibrium, we prove that for (μ, λ), truncation, sequential tournament, best-of-group tournament, and linear ranking selections, the coevolutionary dynamics do not possess the shadowing property. In other words, inﬁnite population simulations cannot be guaranteed to represent real trajectories or to be representative of coevolutionary dynamics of potentially very large, but ﬁnite, populations.},

	abstract = {Recent work on the foundational underpinnings of black-box optimization has begun to uncover a rich mathematical structure. In particular, it is now known that an inner product between the optimization algorithm and the distribution of optimization problems likely to be encountered ﬁxes the distribution over likely performances in running that algorithm. One ramiﬁcation of this is the “No Free Lunch” (NFL) theorems, which state that any two algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems. This highlights the need for exploiting problem-speciﬁc knowledge to achieve better than random performance. In this paper, we present a general framework covering most optimization scenarios. In addition to the optimization scenarios addressed in the NFL results, this framework covers multiarmed bandit problems and evolution of multiple coevolving players. As a particular instance of the latter, it covers “self-play” problems. In these problems, the set of players work together to produce a champion, who then engages one or more antagonists in a subsequent multiplayer game. In contrast to the traditional optimization case where the NFL results hold, we show that in self-play there are free lunches: in coevolution some algorithms have better performance than other algorithms, averaged across all possible problems. However, in the typical coevolutionary scenarios encountered in biology, where there is no champion, the NFL theorems still hold.},
